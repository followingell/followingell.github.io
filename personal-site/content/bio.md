Hey there! 👋

I'm a Senior Data Warehouse Engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com), where we aim to make automation work for everyone 🤖. Previously, I've worked at [Mews](https://www.mews.com) 🏨, [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.com) 🖨️, [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) 📋, and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) 🎮 in various data-related roles 👨‍💻. I hold an [MSc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science#United_Kingdom) in Computer Science 🎓 from the [University of Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham), with a dissertation that focused on efficiently solving the [Team Orienteering Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem#VRP_variants) using genetic algorithms 🧬. My current areas of interest include leveraging Open Source tooling 🧰 in conjunction with Open Data 📊 to build compelling user experiences and/or to improve public services _(see incredible work by [David Gasquez](https://davidgasquez.com/), [Jaime Gómez Obregón](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Gómez-Obregón) or [Jacob Matson](https://github.com/matsonj/nba-monte-carlo) to get an idea of the kind of things I'm talking about ✨)_.

I'm British 🇬🇧, but since 2015, I've been living in sunny Spain 🇪🇸. Outside of work, I love listening to [all kinds of music](https://open.spotify.com/user/ell) 🎵, photography 📷, cycling 🚴‍♂️, and spending time with my girlfriend, Elena 👫.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://x.com/followingell) if you want to get in touch 🤝
